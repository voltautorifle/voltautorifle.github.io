In JavaScript there are two types of comment:
Single line comments starting with // and finishing at the end of the line:
Multi-line comments starting with /* and finishing with */
JavaScript has seven different data types. Six of them are primitive data types and are listed below:
String
Symbol (The symbol primitive data type was only introduced in ES6.)
Number
Boolean
Undefined
Null
Any value that isn’t one of the primitive data types listed above is an object.
const n = 12;
if (n%2 === 0) {
console.log('n is an even number');
} else {
console.log('n is an odd number');
}
<< 'n is an even number'
We’ll start by looking at a while loop. This will repeatedly run a block of code while a certain condition is true, and takes the following structure:let bottles = 10;
while (bottles > 0){
   console.log(`There were ${bottles} green bottles, hanging on a wall. And if one green bottle should accidentally fall, there'd be ${bottles-1} green bottles hanging on the wall`);
   bottles--;
}
You can place a loop inside another loop to create a nested loop. It will have an inner loop that will run all the way through before the next step of the outer loop occurs.
Here’s an example that produces a multiplication table up to 12 x 12:
Copy
for(let i=1 ; j<13 ; i++){
for(let i=1 ; j<13 ; j++){
   console.log(`${j} multiplied by ${i} is ${i*j}`);
   }
}
To define a function literal we can use a function declaration:
Copy
function hello(){
   console.log('Hello World!');
}
