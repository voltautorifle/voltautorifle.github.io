	      An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error. For example, trying to call a method that is nonexistent will result in a reference error that raises an exception. 
An exception will also produce a stack trace. This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred. It’s often not just a single function or method call that causes an error. A stack trace will work backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify the original function or method that started the sequence. The example below shows how a stack trace can help you find where an error originates from:
function three(){ unicorn(); }function two(){ three(); }function one(){ two(); }one();
<< index.html:13 Uncaught ReferenceError: unicorn is not defined    at three (index.html:13)    at two (index.html:17)    at one (index.html:21)    at index.html:24`
Not using strict mode is often referred to as 'sloppy mode' as it’s forgiving of sloppy programming practices. Strict mode encourages a better quality of JavaScript to be written that befits a ninja programmer, so its use is recommended.
Strict mode simply requires the following string to be added to the first line of a JavaScript file:
'use strict';
You can even use strict mode on a per-function basis by adding the line inside a function. Strict mode will then only be applied to anything inside that function:
function strictly(){'use strict';// function code goes here
Linting tools such as JS Lint, JS Hint ,and ES Lint can be used to test the quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode. They are designed to highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain if certain style conventions are not followed, such as how code is indented. They can be very unforgiving and use some opinionated coding conventions, such as not using the ++ and -- increment operators (in the case of JS Lint). Linting tools are also useful for enforcing a programming style guide. This is particularly useful when you are working in a team, as it ensures everybody follows the same conventions.
It's possible to add a linting tool as a text-editor plugin; this will then highlight any sloppy code as you type. Another option is to use an online linting tool that allows you to simply paste onto a page for feedback. Another option is to install linting software on your computer using npm. This can then be run as part of your workflow.
The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert()method to show a dialog at certain points in the code. Because alert()stops a program from running until OK is clicked, it allows us to effectively put breakpoints in the code that let us check the value of variables at that point to see if they’re what we expect them to be.
One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword. This will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to. You can also hover over any variables to see what value they hold at that point. The program can then be restarted by clicking on the 'play' button.
If we suspect a piece of code will result in an exception, we can wrap it in a try block. This will run the code inside the block as normal, but if an exception occurs it will pass the error object that is thrown onto a catch block.
