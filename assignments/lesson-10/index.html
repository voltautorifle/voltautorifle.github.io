All the way back in Chapter 2, we introduced the concept of global variables. These are variables that are created without using the const, let or var keywords. Global variables can be accessed in all parts of the program.
Global variables are actual properties of a global object. In a browser environment, the global object is the window object. This means that any global variable created is actually a property of the window object, as can be seen in the example below:
To create a cookie, you assign it to JavaScript’s “cookie jar”, using the document.cookie property, like so:
document.cookie = 'name=Superman';<< "name=Superman"
The document.cookie property acts like a special type of string. Assigning another cookie to it won’t overwrite the entire property, it will just append it to the end of the string. So we can add more cookies by assigning them to document.cookie:
document.cookie = 'hero=true';<< "hero=true"
document.cookie = 'city=Metropolis';<< "city=Metropolis"
A cookie’s value can be changed by reassigning it to document.cookie using the same name but a different value. The following code will update the value of two of the cookies that we set in the previous section:
document.cookie = 'name=Batman'<< "name=Batman"document.cookie = 'city=Gotham'<< "city=Gotham"
To see the current contents of the cookie jar, simply enter document.cookie
The window object provides some useful methods for scheduling the execution of a function, and for repeatedly executing functions at regular intervals.
The window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter. Try entering the following example into a console. It should show an alert dialog after three seconds (that’s 3000 milliseconds):
window.setTimeout( () => alert("Time's Up!"), 3000);<< 4
The setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements on a web page. As an example, let’s create a web page that shows a colored square, and make it rotate. Create a folder called animation that contains files called index.html, styles.css and main.js. Place the following code inside index.html:
<!doctype html><html lang='en'><head><meta charset='utf-8'><title>Animation Example</title><link rel='stylesheet' href='styles.css'></head><body><div id='square'></div><script src='main.js'></script></body></html>
This places a div on the page with an ID of square.
Next, add the following styles.css:
#square {    margin: 100px;    width: 100px;    height: 100px;    background: #d16;}
This will set the position, dimensions and color of the div. Now for the animation ― add the following code to main.js:
const squareElement = document.getElementById('square');let angle = 0;
setInterval( () => {    angle = (angle + 2) % 360;    squareElement.style.transform = `rotate(${angle}deg)`}, 1000/60);
